A simple web app to book movie tickets.

It allows users to select a movie, specify the hour, add tickets to the cart, and proceed to the checkout page after providing some personal data.

Moreover, it features:
* Breadcrumb nav system
* 3D(-ish) booking system
* A basic JS form validation

The app is fully responsive and optimized for mobile.

This project was developed with React.js and TypeScript, using [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing and [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion/tree/main/packages/framer-motion) for handling animations.

Here's a [demo](https://fc-tickets-booking-app.netlify.app/).
